Object-Oriented Programming course:
* Part 1: Hierarchy, Polymorphism, Object and Exceptions.

* Part 3: GUI & MVC

Design Patterns course:
* Part 1: Collections, Generics, Lambda Expressions, Iterator.

* <https://github.com/TulakHordia>

## Usage
- Run the program and use the built-in console in the IDE to traverse through the options.
- For 'Design Patterns' course Part 1, use Option 14 & 15 in the menu.
- Option 14 -> 1 for question 12.
- Option 14 -> 2 to copy the 'HashMap' from question 12 to a 'HashSet' (Question 13).
- Option 15 to add a new 'Question' to the 'HashSet'.

>   * Known Issues
> * * * For the first part I have used the allQuestions list.
> * * * Located in 'Manager' class, line 28, 124.
> * * * I used 'TreeMap' collection for sorting the 'allQuestions' with duplicates.
> * * * For Q2 (Sub Question 13) I have used a 'HashSet' collection.
> * * * I copied the 'HashMap' into 'HashSet' with the function copyToHashSet();
> * * * Every new value you want to add to the 'HashSet' collection goes to addNewStringToHashSet() and then through StringComparator class
> * * * to compare the new 'Question' with the 'HashSet' values by the String Length and if the letter 'a' shows up the same amount of times in both strings.
> * * * 'StringComparator.class' helps with that.
> * * * The 'HashSet" is then printed using the printHashSet() method.


> * [PART 2 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS]
>	* INSTRUCTIONS
> * * * For part 2 we added 'MyArrayList', 'Observable', 'MyButton', 'MyLabel' classes and 'Observer' interface.

>	* Question 17-18-19-20-21-22 usage:
> * * * Launch the program, press '1' to import the premade questions, select '14' -> '15' -> '19' to copy the previous lists to the new 'MyArrayList'.
> * * * Select '20' to print the newly made 'MyArrayList'.
> * * * Select '21' to remove a question by the question ID.

>	* Question 23-24-25 usage:
> * * * To see how the 'Observer' design pattern works, Select '22' in the menu to Launch the UI.
> * * * Press "Import from a premade questions list".
> * * * Then on the bottom click "Create 'MyArrayList'", this will create all the previous lists and turn the 'Iterator' online
> * * * The newly shown button will print 'MyArrayList' into the IDEs console.


Everything is located in 'manager.class' unless stated otherwise.

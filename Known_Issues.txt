## Usage
- Run the program and use the built-in console in the IDE to traverse through the options.
- Type 1 to import a pre-made questions list, 2 to ignore it (it will import anyway at this point).
- TYPE 3 TO OPEN THE UI.
- For 'Design Patterns' course Part 1, use Options 14 to 17.
- For 'Design Patterns' course Part 2, use Options 18 to 25.

> * [PART 1 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS]
>	* INSTRUCTIONS
> * * * Select [14] to copy and sort allQuestions (ArrayList) into a new collection (TreeSet).
> * * * Select [15] to copy and sort the previous collection (TreeSet) into a new one (LinkedHashSet).
> * * * Select [16] to print the TreeSet.
> * * * Select [17] to print the LinkedHashSet.

> * [PART 2 USAGE INSTRUCTIONS]
>	* INSTRUCTIONS
> * * * Select [18] to copy the previous collection (LinkedHashSet) to 'MyArrayList' (question #17&18).
> * * * Select [19] to print 'MyArrayList'. (question #19).
> * * * Select [20] remove a question from 'MyArrayList'. (question #20).
> * * * * * The remove basically shifts the whole array one step left, overriding the value we want to "Remove".
> * * * * * It doesn't really "REMOVE" it, it overrides it completely and remove the last index (suppoused to be NULL after the shift).
>
> * * * Select [21] to copy the previous collection (LinkedHashSet) to a new one (ArrayList). (question #21).
> * * * Select [22] to print the ArrayList. (question #21).
> * * * Select [23] to remove a question from ArrayList. (question #21).
>
> * * * Options [18],[19],[20] are all located at: Line 933-963 in Manager.class, along with 'MyArrayList.class' that has the rest.
> * * * Options [21],[22],[23] are all located at: Line 965-982 in Manager.class.

> * * * Select [24] to have the whole process done for the 'MyArrayList' part (whole part 1 + [18],[19],[20]).
> * * * Select [25] to do the same with ArrayList.

> * * * TO LAUNCH THE UI EITHER SELECT OPTION [26] OR RESTART THE PROGRAM AND SELECT [3].

>	* Question #23-24-25 usage (Observer Design Pattern):
> * * * To see how the 'Observer' design pattern works, Select [26] in the menu to Launch the UI. OR Select option 3 when launching the whole Program.
> * * * Press "Import from a premade questions list" button located in the middle of the UI.
> * * * Then on the bottom click "Create 'MyArrayList'", this will create all the previous lists and turn the 'Iterator' online.
> * * * The newly shown button will print 'MyArrayList' into the IDEs console.

## Known-Bugs
- None known.
